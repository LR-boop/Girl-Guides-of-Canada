	<h2>What is the history of Girl Guides of Canada?</h2>
		<p>In the last 100 years, 7 million Canadian girls and women have been involved in Guiding.</p>
		<p>Throughout our history, Girl Guides of Canada–Guides du Canada (GGC) has prepared girls to meet the challenges that they face in their lives head on. Whether it was girls learning to bandage wounds during the First World War or girls today working on their anti-bullying badge, Guiding continually evolves to reflect the needs and interests of contemporary girls and women. Today, Guiding's innovative programming is helping the next generation of Canadian girls become confident, courageous and resourceful leaders.</p>
		<p>It all began in 1909, when girls in England demanded to take part in a Boy Scouts rally organized by Lord Baden-Powell at the Crystal Palace in London. Baden-Powell was impressed and he asked his sister, Agnes, to create a program just for girls. This was the beginning of Guiding.</p>
		<p>By 1910, the Guiding Movement had reached Canada and the first Unit was formed in St. Catharine's, Ontario. By 1912, there were units in every province and many of Canada's most forward-thinking women banded together to form the Canadian Girl Guides Association.</p>
		<p>Today, Girl Guides of Canada continues to be a place that sparks the imagination of girls to take their place in the world and take action on what matters to them. As female role models, our adult members support girls to achieve and succeed – through fun, adventures, challenges and international experiences. Guiding continues to play an important role in communities right across Canada.</p>
